Description: pipeable stream that calls your callback
 callback-stream a safe variant of the concat-stream package that will always
 return an array. It does everything callback-stream does, minus the
 concatenation. In fact, it just callbacks you with an array containing your
 good stuff. It is based on the Stream 2 API, but it also works on node v0.8.
 It also support Stream 3, which is bundled with node v0.12 and iojs.
